# MoRide-Portfolio
A centralized collection of my first agile experience's repos, with explanations.

Iteration repo names were fun internal names decided on by team of classmates.

MAJOR NOTE: In retrospect, the security docs on Iteration 4 ("Endgame") are very wrong but better than what the class had for authentication and authorization.

## Iterations (archived, with all issues):

1) [The Mechanical Keyboards](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601-S19/iteration-1-the-mechanical-keyboards)
2) [uhhh](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601-S19/iteration-2-uhhhh-it2)
3) [Toon Squad](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601-S19/iteration-3-toon-squad)
4) [Endgame](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601-S19/iteration-4-endgame)
